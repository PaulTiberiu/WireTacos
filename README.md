# WireTacos

## Subject
WireTacos is a project based on Wireshark. WireTacos is a network protocol analyzer and visualizer entirely coded in C. This is a project made for the network course LU3IN033 at Sorbonne Universit√©.

## Protocols
Here is a list of network protocols that we implemented for our project:
  - Link-layer : Ethernet II (no preamble and no trailer)
  - Network-layer : IPv4, ARP, ICMP
  - Transport-layer : TCP, UDP
  - Application-layer : HTTP

## File organization
You can find all the headers (.h) in the header file.

## How to use it
With the help of a makefile, you just need to write the following command in order to compile our program:
```
make
```
To execute, write:
```
./WireTacos.x
```
Then you will have a menu where, with a file, you can visualize the frames. This is also explained in the  HOW_TO.pdf document

When you are finished, you can quit the program by doing ctrl^C in the terminal and then erase the executable code:
```
make clean
```
